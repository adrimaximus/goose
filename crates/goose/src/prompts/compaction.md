Create a structured handoff summary for a later assistant that will continue this conversation after earlier turns are compacted.

CONVERSATION TO SUMMARIZE:
{{ messages }}

Use this exact structure:

## Goal
[What the user is trying to accomplish]

## Constraints & Preferences
[User preferences, coding style, constraints, important decisions]

## Progress
### Done
[Completed work — include specific file paths, commands run, results obtained]
### In Progress
[Work currently underway]
### Blocked
[Any blockers or issues encountered]

## Key Decisions
[Important technical decisions and why they were made]

## Relevant Files
[Files read, modified, or created — with brief note on each]

## Next Steps
[What needs to happen next to continue the work]

## Critical Context
[Any specific values, error messages, configuration details, or data that would be lost without explicit preservation]

Be specific — include file paths, command outputs, error messages, and concrete values rather than vague descriptions. The goal is to prevent the next assistant from repeating work or losing important details.

Write only the summary body. Do not include any preamble or prefix.
